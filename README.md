## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process
I first started fixing the HTML code then went to start the first page of the rating. First designed the layout with flexbox to center the boxes.
Worked on the star in the circle and afterwards tackled the radio buttons and their different states(not active, hover, clicked). Then finished the submit button.
Once first page was done. Went to the 2nd thank you page. Once both were finished, i linked them together and added the JS code to hide one box and show another.
### Built with
