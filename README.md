## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process
I first started fixing the HTML code then went to start the first page of the rating. First designed the layout with flexbox to center the boxes.
Worked on the star in the circle and afterwards tackled the radio buttons and their different states(not active, hover, clicked). Then finished the submit button.
Once first page was done. Went to the 2nd thank you page. Once both were finished, i linked them together and added the JS code to hide one box and show another.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While this was a simple challenge, it was perfect for a beginner like me. 
Learned how to manipulate displaying elements.
Learned how to stop a default action (site refreshing once you submit a form).
Learned how to change the radio buttons appearance. But I haven't figured how to change the color of the text in button to white. Will be giving a try in a bit.


### Continued development

I'm still not confident in my CSS, i think i made too many classes that are too specific and can't be reused.

My JS is also very basic, while trying to find answers i struggled with some of the syntax and couldn't understand it.
