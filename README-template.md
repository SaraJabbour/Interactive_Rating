### What I learned

While this was a simple challenge, it was perfect for a beginner like me. 
Learned how to manipulate displaying elements.
Learned how to stop a default action (site refreshing once you submit a form).
Learned how to change the radio buttons appearance. But I haven't figured how to change the color of the text in button to white. Will be giving a try in a bit.


### Continued development

I'm still not confident in my CSS, i think i made too many classes that are too specific and can't be reused.

My JS is also very basic, while trying to find answers i struggled with some of the syntax and couldn't understand it.
